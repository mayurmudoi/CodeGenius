# CodeGenius
### CodeGenius is the project name for the Simple login/Signup UI based react native code.
## First we need to Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

#### Node.js 
#### npm 
```
npm install -g npm
```
#### Android Studio (for Android development) or Xcode (for iOS development)

But we will be using Expo Go for Testing. 
 
So even though you don't have Android Studio,you are still good to go.

## Follow these steps to set up the project
#### Clone the repository:
Navigate to the project directory
``` 
cd CodeGenius
```
#### Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### To use Expo Go on Android/iOS:
##### Download the Expo Go app from the Play Store on your Android device/ App Store on your iOS device and open it after installation.
##### Ensure that your Android/ iOS device and the computer running your Expo project are connected to the same network.
##### Open your Expo project in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
##### In your project's root directory, open a terminal or command prompt.
##### Run the command expo start or npm start to start the Expo development server.
##### Once the server starts, it will display a QR code in the terminal.
##### Open the Expo Go app on your Android/iOS device and tap on "Scan QR Code."
##### Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal with your Android/iOS device's camera.
##### Expo Go will load your project and allow you to interact with it on your Android/iOS device.
